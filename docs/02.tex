\section{Code Obfuscation}

In this paper, the focus was only on part of Surreptitious software for making static analysis of a program harder, namely code obfuscation.
Several obfuscation methods were implemented as LLVM \footnote{LLVM is a set of compiler and toolchain technologies \url{https://llvm.org/}}
transformation passes.

The obfuscation passes work on the IR level in LLVM, this allows for the transformations to be language independent.
Any language that has an implementation for the LLVM frontend namely Ada, C, C++, D, Delphi, Fortran, Haskell, Julia, Objective-C, Rust, and Swift
should theoretically work with the transformation passes, it may be the case that some of these languages use LLVM constructs
which weren't considered when implementing the passes and thus may break. The passes were tested with C, C++.

Further, we also achieve platform independence as the modified IR code can then be passed to the LLVM backends, such as x86, PowerPC, ARM, and SPARC,
to then generate code for the given type of CPU \cite{llvm-backend}.

\subsection{Related work}

There are many commercial available code obfuscators, such as Tigress, that support various languages. From the open-source scene
the more known one is \textit{ollvm} which is described in \cite{ollvm}, Since it ended with LLVM version 4.0 other projects started, \cite{Hikari1, Hikari2, YANSOllvm}
that were build upon the codebase and added new transformation passes.

\subsection{My Contribution}

The aim was to implement common obfuscation methods, with some modifications, which are described in \cite{ss-chpt4}.
The LLVM passes were implemented for LLVM v15.0.7, which was the stable version at the time of start of the implementation.

The following methods were implemented

\begin{enumerate}
  \setlength\itemsep{0.5pt} % Adjust the spacing between items
  \item Basic Block Extraction
  \item Operation Substitution
  \item Strings Obfuscation
  \item Opaque Predicates
  \item Function Merging
  \item Introduce Jump into Loop
  \item Control Flow Flattening
  \item Integer Literals Obfuscation
  \item Function Call Obfuscation
  \item Branch Function Obfuscation
  \item Bogus Control Flow
\end{enumerate}
