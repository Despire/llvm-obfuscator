\section{Performance Comparison}

All of the described transformation passes in the previous section have been applied on a simple program
that renders a mesh to the terminal. The result of the benchmark are shown in Figure 9.

Overall the time it took to render a single frame was \textbf{~13,13} times slower then the original program without
obfuscations. The program was executed on an Apple M1 chip.

The program was run via $lli$, without any further optimization passes, which is the LLVM IR code interpreter.

The IR file was generated from compiling the C program, available under the $demo$ folder in the repository with $-emit-llvm$ flag.
